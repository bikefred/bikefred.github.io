I started riding gravel roads about five years ago thanks to encouragement from my good friend Ronnie. As time has passed, I have decided that the only bicycles that I want to own need to be the go-anywhere type. A bike that can be ridden on any road surface so my riding is not limited to "pristine" pavement.

I have owned a variety of bicycles over the past five years for this purpose. The bicycles include: 
- Surly Cross Check  
- Surly 1x1  
- Surly Karate Monkey  
- Rivendell A. Homer Hilson  
- Black Mountain Cycles Monster Cross 

My first exposure to a Salsa Fargo was when my friend Scott bought one from Colonel's Bikes in Ft. Worth, Texas. Scott had been riding a Surly Cross-Check and was looking to try something different. Scott started riding his Fargo on our urban rides and gravel rides in preparation for an upcoming group bicycle tour to South Dakota. In the end - Scott felt that the Fargo was too heavy for his liking as he preferred to ride his Cross-Check. So his Fargo started to sit at home as we continued our gravel riding.

In the meantime, another cycling friend, John, had acquired a very nice new yellow Fargo. John's was a newer model than Scott's, sporting a double crankset, Woodchipper handlebars, and SRAM brifters. John was hooked and he was on that Fargo everywhere! Back to my friend Ronnie... well Ronnie had been riding a Salsa Vaya with 650b wheels to run wider tires. He inquires to Scott about purchasing Scott's lonely Fargo - well before you know it, Ronnie is now riding a Fargo. Since it is disc brake - he moves his 650b wheels on to it and Ronnie rides the Fargo on gravel and for touring. What Ronnie really likes is that the Fargo can run really wide tires!

Fast forward to the summer of 2015 and we are riding a self-contained bicycle tour (on our own) doing the Adirondack Park Loop in New York. I am touring with my Black Mountain Cycles Monster Cross and Ronnie is on his Fargo. Other friends/spouse are riding a variety of bikes including  two Salsa Vayas, one Surly Long Haul Trucker, and two Black Mountain Cycles Monster Crosses. Throughout the tour I was intrigued about the Fargo and its capability to ride well when loaded for touring. We also rode a few gravel roads on the tour and I was wishing for just a little bigger footprint in my tires (the Black Mountain Cycles Monster Cross frame can just squeeze in a 700 x 42 tire).

Ronnie often spoke praises of his Fargo, but I am reminded of his summary of touring on the Fargo, "It is a little heavy and slow on the climbs... but it really can go fast on the downhills!"

Well, I am not afraid of a heavier bike and I enjoy riding uphill - always better scenery to view on the climbs! So in the back of my mind - I had been hoping to acquire a Fargo. So after my wife and I moved to Fredericksburg, Texas last year... I decided it might be time to try a Fargo in the Hill Country of Texas. Fortunately for me there is a local bike shop, Jack and Adams, that happens to be a Salsa dealer. So I decided to order the Salsa Fargo X7 model and take the plunge.

Why I chose the Fargo X7:   
- big wide tire possibilities (up to 2.6" wide tires)   
- lots of ways to attach bags, cargo, and stuff to the frame for touring   
- steel frame (I like steel)   
- disc brakes (good stopping power in wet weather)   
- fairly decent component spec (even though I will replace many things to my preferences)  
- capable of even riding rough single-track   

So stay tuned - off on the Fargo I go!
